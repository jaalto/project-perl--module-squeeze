How to build this distribution

        To install this module, make sure you are in the directory where
        this README file is in and type:

            perl Makefile.PL        # to build the Makefile
            make install            # to install the module

        After installation, you should be able to "man
        Lingua::EN::Squeeze" which will get you to usage information for
        the module. Alternative, if that does not work, user Perl command
        "perldoc Lingua::EN:Squeeze"

End
